Professional statement outline 


1. Strong Verbal and written communication, organization, multitasking, Coding, and Splunk experience are strengths that I have and are currently interested in developing further. Willingness and eagerness to learn.
.
2. Protecting people, raising cyber security and space exploration awareness are values that I hold dear.

3. What interests me the most about cybersecurity is the thrill of learning new practical skills that I can use to help organizations , and other people, my self included.I also want to bridge my cybersecurity and space exploration interests. From hacking java chatrooms at age 10, to editing ranges, misplaces, and tumblrs via coding from age 13-16, I have since then acquired an interest and knowledge in cybersecurity, coding,  and ethical hacking, getting paid for it while learning  more intricate skills, would seem like a dream.


Cyber security recruiters, certain government employers, and eventually specific organizations are the audience for my professional statement.

With my strengths and values people will be able to do their jobs and lively their lives, safely and amicably. With strong yet easy going, minimally complicated  communication, conflicts  and issues will be resolved promptly and amicably. With coding and splunk experience I will be able to aid organizations security as it pertains to internet via the organization or persons website or email.
